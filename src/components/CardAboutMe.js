This would allow me to have a second professional experience in the world of web development, the first being in my secondary school internship at (entreprise). I could make myself useful within your company, I already have skills in the web creation and I am convinced that this internship will expand my knowledge in many areas. I look forward to meeting you soon to share my motivation with you. In the meantime, best regards.</p>
